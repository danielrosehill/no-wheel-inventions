# No Wheel Inventions - Starting Instruction

When developing this application, please keep the following general request in mind:

We should only create custom elements, such as front-end designs, when we cannot find a fitting, pre-existing template. Our general development philosophy is to "build on the shoulders of giants." Where possible, we try to avoid reinventing the wheel—hence *No Wheel Inventions*.

If there are multiple good foundations for a project, we can consider which is the most suitable to build upon. However, wherever possible, we try to leverage existing components in our stack instead of creating everything from scratch.

# No Wheel Inventions - Template Check

Before we begin building this feature or component, let's search for existing templates and solutions.

Following our *No Wheel Inventions* philosophy, please:

1. **Search for Templates**: Look for existing starter templates, boilerplates, or scaffolds that match our requirements. Consider:
   - Official framework starters (Next.js templates, Astro themes, etc.)
   - Community-maintained templates
   - Component library starters

2. **Identify Reusable Components**: Search for existing components that could serve as a foundation:
   - UI component libraries with pre-built versions of what we need
   - Icon libraries (Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor, etc.)
   - Layout systems and grid frameworks
   - Animation libraries with ready-made effects

3. **Evaluate Options**: For each candidate, consider:
   - How well does it match our needs?
   - Is it actively maintained?
   - Will we benefit from upstream updates and improvements?
   - What customization is needed vs building from scratch?

4. **Make a Recommendation**: Suggest the best foundation to build upon, or confirm that custom development is genuinely the best approach for this specific case.

Remember: Using existing templates means benefiting from ongoing upstream development. A theme that receives updates will improve our project automatically.

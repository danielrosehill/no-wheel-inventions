# No Wheel Inventions - Retrospective

Take a look at the state of this application to date.

Consider the extent that we might have missed opportunities to leverage existing frameworks in our stack and development. Our general philosophy is to build on the shoulders of giants rather than try to create things that have already been well developed and engineered—*no wheel inventions*.

Review the existing stack and codebase from this perspective. If you are able to identify any places where custom implementations could be replaced by more robust existing solutions that we can benefit from the update cycle of, then suggest where we can replace those elements.
